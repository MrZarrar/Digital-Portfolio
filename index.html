  <section class="about" id="about">

    <div class="about-content">
      <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
      <p>As a Computer Science undergraduate at Royal Holloway, University of London, I am driven by a passion for problem-solving and innovation. My academic journey is complemented by a diverse range of experiences, from leading technical projects to engaging in creative pursuits.</p>
      <p class="hidden-content" style="display: none;">During my first year, I spearheaded a team to design and program an autonomous robot using the Lego Mindstorms EV3 platform. This project honed my skills in leadership, programming (Java, EV3Dev), and teamwork, culminating in the successful delivery of a functional robot that autonomously sorted objects by color—graded A+. <br><br>

        Beyond academics, I have honed my technical expertise as a freelance AI Trainer at Outlier AI, crafting challenging prompts and evaluating AI responses to refine cutting-edge systems. My role demands attention to detail, creativity, and adherence to rigorous rubrics, skills that I continually refine.<br><br>

        My passion for understanding complex systems extends beyond technology to the human body. Volunteering as a pharmacy assistant and participating in competitions like “Body in the Box” have taught me resilience, empathy, and adaptability—qualities I bring to all facets of my work.<br><br>

        Outside of academics and work, I channel my creativity into art, transitioning from traditional mediums to digital formats. This hobby has cultivated patience, independence, and innovative thinking.<br><br>

        I am always eager to explore new challenges, leveraging my skills in programming, AI training, and creative problem-solving to contribute meaningfully to technology and beyond.</p>
